Tes# Dr. Taslima Akter – Personal Website Prototype

This Repo contains the functional HTML/CSS/JavaScript prototype I built for **CS 5153 – User Interfaces & Usability (Project 3: Design and Implementation)**. The goal is to redesign and implement Dr. Taslima Akter’s personal website based on user research, a persona, user stories, cognitive walkthrough, and heuristic evaluation.

The primary user story is a **prospective graduate student (John)** who wants to quickly see whether a professor’s research and publications match their interests and then decide whether to contact them.

## How to run the site

Because the navbar and footer are loaded with `fetch()` from HTML partials, you should serve the site over HTTP (not just open `index.html` with `file://`).
